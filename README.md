# Food Delivery Routing Optimization System

## Description
This project aims to optimize food delivery routing using graph traversal techniques. It reads input data from a file, constructs a grid-based graph representing delivery locations, calculates the shortest paths from a starting point (a restaurant) to various customer locations, and determines the total time required to serve all customers.

## Group Members
- Shaheer Haq (21i-1657)
- Azeem Ahmad (21i-1720)
- Sheharyar Bhatti (21i-2670)

## Files Included
- `main.cpp`: Contains the C++ code for the project.
- `input.txt`: Sample input data format.
- `readme.md`: This file.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Compile**: Use any C++ compiler to compile `main.cpp`.
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o food_delivery
2. Input File: Ensure input.txt is present in the same directory as the executable.
   - Format: The file should contain the number of test cases followed by grid dimensions, rider information, and order details.
3. Execution: Run the compiled executable.
    ./food_delivery

   
## Output
The program outputs the total time taken for all customers to get served for each test case.

## Dependencies
C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
Standard C++ libraries (fstream, iostream, etc.)

## Notes
The program assumes an input format as described in input.txt.
Adjustments may be needed for different input formats or additional features.
